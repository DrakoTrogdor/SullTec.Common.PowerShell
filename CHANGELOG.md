            - At release time, you can move the Unreleased section changes into a new release version section.

        - There should be an entry for every single version.
        - The same types of changes should be grouped.
        - Versions and sections should be linkable.
        - The latest version comes first.
        - The release date of each version is displayed.
        - Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

    - MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
    - PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
    - Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
